Comet Cache is an advanced WordPress caching plugin inspired by simplicity. Speed up your site (BIG time!) with an intelligent and easy-to-use cache.

== Description ==

If you care about the speed of your site, Comet Cache is one of those plugins that you absolutely MUST have installed :-) Comet Cache takes a real-time snapshot (building a cache) of every Page, Post, Category, Link, etc. These snapshots are then stored (cached) intuitively, so they can be referenced later, in order to save all of that processing time that has been dragging your site down and costing you money.

The Comet Cache plugin uses configuration options that you select from the options panel. See: **Comet Cache -› Options** in your Dashboard. Once a file has been cached, Comet Cache uses advanced techniques that allow it to recognize when it should and should not serve a cached version of the file. By default, Comet Cache does not serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes.

= Features =

- SIMPLE and well-documented configuration (just enable and you're all set!).
- Options to control the automatic cache clearing behavior for Home and Posts Page, Author Page, Category, Tag, and Custom Term Archives, Custom Post Type Archives, RSS/RDF/ATOM Feeds, and XML Sitemaps.
- URI exclusion patterns (now supporting wildcards too).
- User-Agent exclusion patterns (now supporting wildcards too).
- HTTP referrer exclusion patterns (now supporting wildcards too).
- The ability to set an automatic expiration time for cache files.
- Client-Side Caching (to allow double-caching in the client-side browser).
- Caching for 404 requests to reduce the impact of those requests on the server.
- RSS, RDF, and Atom Feed caching.
- The ability to cache or ignore URLs that contain query strings (GET Requests).
- An Advanced Cache Plugin system for theme and plugin developers.

= Pro Features =

- The ability to cache logged-in users too! (VERY powerful, particularly for membership sites).
- A new improved "Clear Cache" button in the admin bar (along with an option to enable/disable this feature).
- The ability to disable Dashboard notifications related to automatic clearing/purging on change detections.
- The ability to clear Markdown-related cache files generated by the s2Clean theme for WordPress (if installed).
- The ability to run custom PHP code whenever the cache is cleared.
- Cache Statistics to help you gain insight into the status of your site cache.
- Import/Export functionality for Comet Cache configuration files.
- A Dynamic Version Salt (customize the caching engine).
- HTML Compressor to automatically combine and compresses CSS/JS/HTML code.
- Auto-Cache Engine to pre-cache your site at 15-minute intervals.
- Static CDN Filters to serve some and/or ALL static files on your site from a CDN of your choosing, including support for Multiple CDN Host Names, Domain Sharding, and WordPress Multisite Networks.
- An Automatic Updater to update Comet Cache Pro from your WordPress Dashboard.
- Rockstar support for all Comet Cache features.

TIP: you can preview Pro features in the free version by clicking the "Preview Pro Features" link at the top of your Comet Cache options.

== Installation ==

**Quick Tip:** WordPress® can only deal with one cache plugin being activated at a time. Please uninstall any existing cache plugins that you've tried in the past. In other words, if you've installed W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, DB Cache Reloaded, or any other caching plugin, uninstall them all before installing Comet Cache. One way to check, is to make sure this file: `wp-content/advanced-cache.php` and/or `wp-content/object-cache.php` are NOT present; and if they are, delete these files BEFORE installing Comet Cache. Those files will only be present if you have a caching plugin already installed. If you don't see them, you're ready to install Comet Cache :-).

**A note for existing ZenCache users:** Comet Cache is the successor to ZenCache and will automatically detect any existing ZenCache options and migrate that options over to Comet Cache. For further details, please see the [migration FAQ](https://cometcache.com/r/zencache-migration-faq/).

= Comet Cache is Very Easy to Install =

1. Upload the `/comet-cache` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress®.
3. Navigate to the **Comet Cache** panel & enable it.

= How will I know Comet Cache is Working? =

First of all, make sure that you've enabled Comet Cache. After you activate the plugin in WordPress, go to the Comet Cache options panel and enable caching (you can't miss the big yellow checkbox). Then scroll to the bottom and click Save All Changes. All of the other options on that page are already pre-configured for typical usage. Skip them all for now. You can go back through all of these later and fine-tune things the way you like them.

Once Comet Cache has been enabled, **you'll need to log out** (and/or clear browser cookies). Cache files are NOT served to visitors who are logged in, and that includes you too :-) Cache files are NOT served to recent commenters either. If you've commented (or replied to a comment lately); please clear your browser cookies before testing.

**To verify that Comet Cache is working**, navigate your site like a normal visitor would. Right-click on any page (choose View Source), then scroll to the very bottom of the document. At the bottom, you'll find comments that show Comet Cache stats and information. You should also notice that page-to-page navigation is lightning fast compared to what you experienced prior to installing Comet Cache.

= Running Comet Cache On A WordPress® Multisite Installation =

WordPress® Multisite Networking is a special consideration in WordPress®. If Comet Cache is installed under a Multisite Network installation, it will be enabled for ALL blogs the same way. The centralized config options for Comet Cache, can only be modified by a Super Administrator operating on the main site. Comet Cache has internal processing routines that prevent configuration changes, including menu displays; for anyone other than a Super Administrator operating on the main site.

= EMERGENCY: If All Else Fails (How-To Remove Comet Cache) =

Ordinarily you can just deactivate Comet Cache from the plugins menu in WordPress. However, if you're having a more serious issue, please follow the instructions here.

1. Log into your site via FTP; perhaps using [FileZilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joXUMhr8PhU).
2. Delete this file: `/wp-content/advanced-cache.php`
3. Delete this directory: `/wp-content/plugins/comet-cache/`
4. Remove this line from your `/wp-config.php` file: `define('WP_CACHE', TRUE);`

Comet Cache is now completely uninstalled and you can start fresh :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have ZenCache installed; how do I install Comet Cache? =

Comet Cache is the successor to ZenCache and will automatically detect any existing ZenCache options and migrate those options over to Comet Cache. For further details, please see the [migration FAQ](https://cometcache.com/r/zencache-migration-faq/).

You should also notice that page-to-page navigation is lightning fast compared to what you experienced prior to installing Comet Cache.

= What is the down side to running Comet Cache? =

There is NOT one! Comet Cache is a MUST HAVE for every WordPress® powered site. In fact, we really can't think of any site running WordPress® that would want to be without it. To put it another way, the WordPress® software itself comes with a built in action reference for an `advanced-cache.php` file, because WordPress® developers realize the importance of such as plugin. The `/wp-content/advanced-cache.php` file is named as such, because the WordPress® developers expect it to be there when caching is enabled by a plugin. If you don't have the `/wp-content/advanced-cache.php` file yet, it is because you have not enabled Comet Cache from the options panel yet.

= So why does WordPress® need to be cached? =

To understand how Comet Cache works, first you have to understand what a cached file is, and why it is absolutely necessary for your site and every visitor that comes to it. WordPress® (by its very definition) is a database-driven publishing platform. That means you have all these great tools on the back-end of your site to work with, but it also means that every time a Post/Page/Category is accessed on your site, dozens of connections to the database have to be made, and literally thousands of PHP routines run in harmony behind-the-scenes to make everything jive. The problem is, for every request that a browser sends to your site, all of these routines and connections have to be made (yes, every single time). Geesh, what a waste of processing power, memory, and other system resources. After all, most of the content on your site remains the same for at least a few minutes at a time. If you've been using WordPress® for very long, you've probably noticed that (on average) your site does not load up as fast as other sites on the web. Now you know why!

In computer science, a cache (pronounced /kash/) is a collection of data duplicating original values stored elsewhere or computed earlier, where the original data is expensive to fetch (owing to longer access time) or to compute, compared to the cost of reading the cache. In other words, a cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be stored for rapid access. Once the data is stored in the cache, it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data.

= Where & why are the cache files stored on my server? =

The cache files are stored in a special directory: `/wp-content/cache/comet-cache`. This directory needs to remain writable, just like the `/wp-content/uploads` directory on many WordPress® installations. The `/comet-cache/cache` directory is where cache files reside. These files are stored using an intutive directory structure that named based on the request URL (`HTTPS/HTTP_HOST/REQUEST_URI`). See also: **Dashboard -› Comet Cache -› Cache Directory/Expiration Time** for further details.

Whenever a request comes in from someone on the web, Comet Cache checks to see if it can serve a cached file; e.g. it looks at the `HTTPS/HTTP_HOST/REQUEST_URI` environent variables, then it checks the `/comet-cache/cache` directory. If a cache file has been built already, and it matches an existing `HTTPS.HTTP_HOST.REQUEST_URI` combination; and it is not too old (see: **Dashboard -› Comet Cache -› Cache Directory/Expiration Time**), then it will serve that file instead of asking WordPress® to regenerate it. This adds tremendous speed to your site and reduces server load.

If you have GZIP compression enabled, then the cache file is also sent to the browser with compression (recommended). Modern web browsers that support this technique will definitely take advantage of it. After all, if it is easier to email a zip file, it's also easier to download a web page that way. That is why on-the-fly GZIP compression for web pages is recommended. This is supported by all modern browsers.

If you want to enable GZIP, create an `.htaccess` file in your WordPress® installation directory and put the following few lines in it. Alternatively, if you already have an `.htaccess` file, just add these lines to it, and that is all there is to it. GZIP is now enabled!

	<IfModule deflate_module>
		<IfModule filter_module>
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain text/html
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml application/xml application/xhtml+xml application/xml-dtd
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rdf+xml application/rss+xml application/atom+xml image/svg+xml
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/x-javascript
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf font/opentype application/font-otf application/x-font-otf
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf font/truetype application/font-ttf application/x-font-ttf
		</IfModule>
	</IfModule>

If your installation of Apache does not have `mod_deflate` installed. You can also enable GZIP compression using PHP configuration alone. In your `php.ini` file, you can simply add the following line anywhere: `zlib.output_compression = on`

= What happens if a user logs in? Are cache files used then? =

By default, Comet Cache does NOT serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes. That being said, the Pro version of Comet Cache DOES make it possible to cache pages even when users ARE logged-in; adding even more speed! This is particularly helpful on membership sites; e.g. sites that run plugins like s2Member™ for instance.

= Will comments and other dynamic parts of my blog update immediately? =

It depends on your configuration of Comet Cache. There is an automatic expiration system (the garbage collector), which runs through WordPress® behind-the-scene, according to your Expiration setting (see: **Dashboard -› Comet Cache -› Cache Directory/Expiration Time**). There is also a built-in expiration time on existing files that is checked before any cache file is served up, which also uses your Expiration setting. In addition; whenever you update a Post or a Page, Comet Cache can automatically prune that particular file from the cache so it instantly becomes fresh again. Otherwise, your visitors would need to wait for the previous cached version to expire.

By default, Comet Cache does NOT serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes.

= How do I enable GZIP compression? Is GZIP supported? =

There is no need to use an `.htaccess` file with this plugin; caching is handled by WordPress®/PHP alone. That being said, if you also want to take advantage of GZIP compression (and we do recommend this), then you WILL need an `.htaccess` file to accomplish that part. This plugin fully supports GZIP compression on its output. However, it does not handle GZIP compression directly. We purposely left GZIP compression out of this plugin, because GZIP compression is something that should really be enabled at the Apache level or inside your `php.ini` file. GZIP compression can be used for things like JavaScript and CSS files as well, so why bother turning it on for only WordPress-generated pages when you can enable GZIP at the server level and cover all the bases!

If you want to enable GZIP, create an `.htaccess` file in your WordPress® installation directory and put the following few lines in it. Alternatively, if you already have an `.htaccess` file, just add these lines to it, and that is all there is to it. GZIP is now enabled!

	<IfModule deflate_module>
		<IfModule filter_module>
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain text/html

			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/x-javascript
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf font/opentype application/font-otf application/x-font-otf
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf font/truetype application/font-ttf application/x-font-ttf
		</IfModule>
	</IfModule>

If your installation of Apache does not have `mod_deflate` installed. You can also enable gzip compression using PHP configuration alone. In your `php.ini` file, you can simply add the following line anywhere: `zlib.output_compression = on`

= I'm a plugin developer. How can I prevent certain files from being cached? =

	<?php
	define('COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED', FALSE); // The easiest way.
	// or $_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED'] = FALSE; // Also very easy.
	// or define('DONOTCACHEPAGE', TRUE); // For compatibility with other cache plugins.

When your script finishes execution, Comet Cache will know that it should NOT cache that particular page. It does not matter where or when you define this Constant; e.g. `define('COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED', FALSE);` because Comet Cache is the last thing to run during execution. So as long as you define this Constant at some point in your routines, everything will be fine.

Comet Cache also provides support for `define('DONOTCACHEPAGE', TRUE)`, which is used by the WP Super Cache plugin as well. Another option is: `$_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED'] = FALSE`. The `$_SERVER` array method is useful if you need to disable caching at the Apache level using `mod_rewrite`. The `$_SERVER` array is filled with all environment variables, so if you use `mod_rewrite` to set the `COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED` environment variable, that will end up in `$_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED']`. All of these methods have the same end result, so it's up to you which one you'd like to use.

= What should my expiration setting be? =

If you don't update your site much, you could set this to `6 months`; optimizing everything even further. The longer the cache expiration time is, the greater your performance gain. Alternatively, the shorter the expiration time, the fresher everything will remain on your site. A default value of `7 days` (recommended expiration time), is a good conservative middle-ground.

Keep in mind that your expiration setting is only one part of the big picture. Comet Cache will also purge the cache automatically as changes are made to the site (i.e. you edit a post, someone comments on a post, you change your theme, you add a new navigation menu item, etc., etc.). Thus, your expiration time is really just a fallback; e.g. the maximum amount of time that a cache file could ever possibly live.

That being said, you could set this to just `60 seconds` and you would still see huge differences in speed and performance. If you're just starting out with Comet Cache (perhaps a bit nervous about old cache files being served to your visitors); you could set this to something like `30 minutes` and experiment with it while you build confidence in Comet Cache. It's not necessary, but many site owners have reported this makes them feel like they're more-in-control when the cache has a short expiration time. All-in-all, it's a matter of preference :-)

= EMERGENCY: If all else fails, how can I remove Comet Cache? =

Ordinarily you can just deactivate Comet Cache from the plugins menu in WordPress. However, if you're having a more serious issue, please follow the instructions here.

1. Log into your site via FTP; perhaps using [FileZilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joXUMhr8PhU).
2. Delete this file: `/wp-content/advanced-cache.php`
3. Delete this directory: `/wp-content/plugins/comet-cache/`
4. Remove this line from your `/wp-config.php` file: `define('WP_CACHE', TRUE);`

Comet Cache is now completely uninstalled and you can start fresh :-)

Once the data is stored in the cache, it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data.

= Prepare To Be Amazed / It's Time To Speed Things Up =

Comet Cache is extremely reliable, because it runs completely in PHP code, and does not hand important decisions off to the `mod_rewrite` engine or browser cache; also making Comet Cache MUCH easier to setup and configure.

In addition, Comet Cache actually sends a no-cache header (yes, a no-cache header); which allows it to remain in control at all times. It might seem weird that a caching plugin would send a no-cache header :-). Well, no-cache headers are a key component in this plugin, and they will NOT affect performance negatively. On the contrary, this is how the system can accurately serve cache files to public users vs. users who are logged-in, commenters, etc.

If you care about the speed of your site, Comet Cache is one of those plugins that you absolutely MUST have installed :-) Comet Cache takes a real-time snapshot (building a cache) of every Page, Post, Category, Link, etc. These snapshots are then stored (cached) intuitively, so they can be referenced later, in order to save all of that processing time that has been dragging your site down and costing you money.

As announced in the previous release, ZenCache / Comet Cache no longer runs with the PHP APC extension enabled as of December 1st, 2015. Please see announcement with further details: [PHP APC Extension No Longer Supported](http://zencache.com/r/php-apc-extension-no-longer-supported/)
- **Announcement: After March 1st, 2016 ZenCache / Comet Cache will require PHP Multibyte String support.** The `mbstring` extension provides Multibyte String support to PHP and is required to properly handle UTF-8 characters, which many sites now use. Without Multibyte String support, caching will be unstable. For that reason we are requiring the `mbstring` extension to improve reliability when caching and to prevent your site from experiencing unforeseen issues in the future.
- **Announcement: Restructured Codebase**. The entire ZenCache Lite codebase has been restructured to improve performance, enhance flexibility, and make it easier to build in new features! This release of ZenCache Lite has been built from the ZenCache Pro codebase, which is more polished and up-to-date. This release includes many changes and improvements that were released as part of ZenCache Pro releases over the past 6 months and are now being included in the Lite version. See the full changelog below for a complete list of changes.
- **New Feature!** A new watered-down Regular Expression syntax is now supported in several existing ZenCache features, including XML Sitemap Patterns, URI Exclusion Patterns, HTTP Referrer Exclusion Patterns, and User-Agent Exclusion Patterns. (It is also supported in the Pro-only Custom URLs to Auto-Clear, and the HTML Compressor CSS Exclusion Patterns and JavaScript Exclusion Patterns.) This new syntax greatly increases the power and flexibility of each of these features and makes things possible like the much-requested ability to Auto-Clear the Home Page or Posts Page of a site whenever a post cache is cleared. For more information on this new watered-down Regular Expression syntax, [this KB Article](http://zencache.com/r/watered-down-regex-syntax/). Props @kristineds @jaswsinc. See [Issue #191](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/191).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a bug with clearing cache files for paginated pages where the `pagination_base` had been changed from the default `page` to something else (e.g., a translated string). The WP Rewrite API is now used to include `pagination_base` and `comments_pagination_base` when building paths to cache files to determine which cache files should be cleared. Props @renzms. See [Issue #607](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/607).
- **Bug Fix**: This release attempts to resolve reports of Error 500 and Internal Server Error issues when running with PHP 5.6 + OPcache. Instead of clearing the entire Opcode cache whenever the plugin options are saved, we only invalidate the `advanced-cache.php` file, which is rebuilt each time you update your configuration options. Props @jaswsinc. Also props to @MarioKnight and @CotswoldPhoto for helping us narrow this down. See [Issue #624](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/624).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where a PHP Notice was generated when an inactive WordPress component was being upgraded. This issue did not have any adverse affect on the site, but this fix resolves the issue so that the notice won't appear in PHP logs. See [Issue #589](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/589).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a bug where a commented-out `WP_CACHE` definition in `wp-config.php` (such as what WP Super Cache leaves behind) was being incorrectly ignored and resulted in caching being silently disabled. Props @davidfavor. See [Issue #591](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/591).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a bug where in some scenarios a page might not be cached due to a stray `AUTH_COOKIE` or `SECURE_AUTH_COOKIE` cookie, even when the user is not logged in. Props @jaswsinc @renzms. See [Issue #592](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/592).
- **Enhancement**: Excluded several unnecessary files from the plugin zip file that were being used during the build process but were not necessary to run the plugin. Props @bridgeport. See [Issue #579](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/579).
- **Enhancement**: When the Cache Directory location is changed, ZenCache now cleans up the old Cache Directory and any old cache files instead of leaving them behind. Props @clavaque @renzms. See [Issue #580](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/580).
- **Enhancement**: Added a new API Function that allows a site owner to clear the cache for a specific URL via `zencache::clearUrl($url);`. See [this article](http://zencache.com/kb-article/clearing-the-cache-dynamically/#toc-988085ad) for further details. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #590](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/590).
- **Enhancement**: Improved the HTML Notes generated by ZenCache when s2Member (a membership plugin for WordPress) is specifically disabling caching. s2Member automatically disables caching on certain pages that are required to remain dynamic. The HTML Notes generated by ZenCache now explain when this is happening. Props @renzms. See [Issue #504](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/504).
- **Enhancement**: In Logged-In User Caching, the "Yes, but DON'T maintain a separate cache for each user" option has been hidden because this particular option has the potential to create a security issue if not configured properly. If you were already using this option, it will not be hidden and it will continue to work. Otherwise, if you require this particular option you can now enable it using a filter (see [this comment](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/497#issuecomment-146060440)). Props @renzms @jaswsinc. See [Issue #497](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/497).
- **Enhancement**: The Auto-Cache Engine now detects when the configured XML Sitemap is not valid or is unreachable and displays an appropriate notice. Props @kristineds and @jaswsinc. See [Issue #555](https://github.com/websharks/zencache/issues/555).
